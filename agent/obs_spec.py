# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Purpose of this module
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This file provides two closely related utilities that enforce a strict and
# stable observation schema:
#
#   1) split_obs_flat(obs)
#        Takes a flat observation tensor (B, OBS_DIM) and splits it into:
#          - rays_flat  : (B, RAYS_FLAT_DIM)
#          - rich_base  : (B, RICH_BASE_DIM)
#          - instinct   : (B, INSTINCT_DIM)
#
#   2) build_semantic_tokens(rich_base, instinct)
#        Builds a dictionary of semantic feature groups by selecting specific
#        index subsets from rich_base, plus an instinct token.
#
# Why strict schema enforcement matters:
# - Reinforcement learning policies are extremely sensitive to feature ordering.
# - Any silent mismatch (wrong indices, wrong slice boundaries) can ruin training
#   without causing an immediate exception.
# - This code chooses "fail loudly" behavior to prevent silent corruption.
#
# Performance note:
# - The semantic feature indices are cached as torch tensors per-device to avoid
#   allocating a new index tensor on every forward pass / timestep.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------


# Cache index tensors per (device, name) to avoid per-step allocations.
#
# Key:
#   (torch.device, token_name) -> LongTensor indices on that device
#
# This is important because:
# - torch.index_select expects an index tensor on the same device as the source.
# - Re-creating index tensors inside the simulation loop creates avoidable
#   allocation overhead and can fragment GPU memory over long runs.

              "own_context", "world_context", ...

        device:
            The torch device on which the returned index tensor must live.
            This must match rich_base.device to keep index_select valid.

    Returns:
        idx:
            1D LongTensor of indices on the requested device.

    Implementation details:
    - We cache the resulting tensor because:
        * Converting Python lists -> torch tensors is a runtime allocation.
        * Doing this per-step in an RL simulation would be unnecessarily expensive.
    - The cache is keyed by (device, name) because:
        * The same indices must exist separately on CPU vs GPU.
        * The same logical token name maps to the same index list.

    """
    Build semantic token tensors from rich_base and instinct components.

    Inputs:
        rich_base:
            Shape (B, RICH_BASE_DIM).
            This is the dense feature block that contains many different feature groups.

        instinct:
            Shape (B, INSTINCT_DIM).
            This is a separate compact block meant to be treated as its own token.

    Output:
        A dictionary mapping token name -> tensor, containing:
          - "own_context"
          - "world_context"
          - "zone_context"

        many indices are assigned to that token in config.SEMANTIC_RICH_BASE_INDICES.

        All outputs reside on the same device as rich_base (and therefore instinct).

    Conceptual purpose:
    - rich_base is a flat vector but it contains structured information.
    - config.SEMANTIC_RICH_BASE_INDICES defines which columns correspond to which
      semantic group.
    - This function materializes those groups explicitly by selecting columns.

    Implementation notes:
    - torch.index_select is used to select columns by index:
        tok = index_select(rich_base, dim=1, index=idx)
      where idx is a 1D LongTensor of column indices.

    Correctness notes:
    - This function enforces strict dimensional checks.
    - It also ensures batch dimension consistency across rich_base and instinct.
