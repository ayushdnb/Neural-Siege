# ============================================================================
# Action Masking with Optional Line-of-Sight (LOS) Wall Blocking
# ============================================================================
# This module builds an action mask for each agent in a grid-based simulation.
#
# "Action mask" meaning:
#   - A boolean tensor mask[N, A] where:
#       mask[n, a] = True  -> action "a" is currently valid for agent "n"
#       mask[n, a] = False -> action "a" is invalid and should be disallowed
#
# This is typically used in RL with discrete actions to:
#   - prevent illegal actions from being sampled by the policy
#   - reduce wasted exploration on impossible moves
#   - simplify credit assignment by removing nonsensical actions
#
# The environment uses an occupancy grid:
#   grid: (3, H, W) float
#     - channel 0 (grid[0]) is occupancy / type map.
#       Values used in this file:
#         0.0 = empty
#         1.0 = wall
#         2.0 = team red (or red unit marker)
#         3.0 = team blue (or blue unit marker)
#       (Other channels exist but are not used in this mask builder.)
#
# "Teams" tensor:
#   teams: (N,) float where team identity is encoded as 2.0 (red) or 3.0 (blue)
#
# "Units" tensor:
#   unit: (N,) where:
#     1 = soldier
#     2 = archer
#
# Action layout:
#   A = config.NUM_ACTIONS
#   Two supported layouts are implied by code:
#     - A <= 17: idle + 8 moves + 8 melee attacks (range 1 only)
#     - A  = 41: idle + 8 moves + (8 directions × 4 ranges) ranged attack actions
#
# Optional LOS rule:
#   If config.ARCHER_LOS_BLOCKS_WALLS is True:
#     - ranged attacks are disabled when a wall exists in any intermediate cell
#       between attacker and target along that direction.
# ============================================================================

#   - x increases to the right

    Compute line-of-sight blocking due to walls (occupancy value == 1.0) on channel 0.

    Returns:
        blocked: (N, 8, RMAX) boolean tensor where:
          blocked[n, d, r] == True means:
            along direction d, there exists at least one wall in the intermediate cells
            between the attacker and a target at range (r+1).

    Clarifying the "range index":
        - The function returns a dimension of size RMAX corresponding to target ranges:
              r = 1..RMAX (in world-space steps)
          But stored in the tensor at index:
              r_index = r - 1
          Hence blocked[:, :, 0] corresponds to r = 1.

    Intermediate-cell rule:
        - For an attack at range r, intermediate steps are 1..(r-1).
        - If r == 1, there are no intermediate cells, so LOS cannot be blocked by "in-between" walls.

    Practical interpretation:
        - This function is designed for ranged line-of-sight checks along 8-direction rays.
        - It does not check the target cell itself for being a wall; it checks only intermediate cells.
          (Target validity is handled elsewhere by verifying the target contains an enemy.)

    Performance considerations:
        - The function vectorizes wall detection for all agents N, all directions 8, and all intermediate steps.
        - The final step aggregates over intermediate cells using .any(dim=2).
        - The final loop over r=1..RMAX is small (RMAX is 4), so it is inexpensive.
