# =============================================================================
# This module implements agent spawning strategies and team-aware brain selection.
#
# The code operates within a grid-based simulation where:
#   - The world state is represented by a 3-channel tensor grid[C, H, W].
#   - Agents are tracked in an AgentsRegistry (dense tensor + module lists).
#   - Each spawned agent is assigned:
#       (i)  a position (x, y),
#       (ii) a unit type (soldier vs archer) with corresponding stats,
#       (iii) a "brain" (policy/controller network) chosen by configurable rules.
#
# A central design objective is to keep the spawning logic:
#   - deterministic when desired (via seeds),
#   - configurable (via config module knobs),
#   - efficient (vectorizable where possible, minimal bookkeeping).
#
# IMPORTANT: Per your instruction, the executable code is not modified.
# Only explanatory comments are added.

def _rect_dims(n: int, max_cols: int, max_rows: int) -> Tuple[int, int, int]:
    """Calculates dimensions for a compact rectangle to place n agents.

    PURPOSE
    -------
    When spawning agents in formations, we typically want to arrange them in a
    compact rectangle (rows × cols) that can fit inside a constrained region.

    Given:
      - n: desired number of placements,
      - max_cols: maximum allowable columns,
      - max_rows: maximum allowable rows,

    we return:
      - cols: chosen number of columns,
      - rows: chosen number of rows,
      - n_eff: effective number of agents that can fit (<= n)

    KEY DESIGN PRINCIPLES
    ---------------------
    1) Compactness:
       A near-square rectangle minimizes perimeter for a given area. A standard
       heuristic is to set cols ≈ sqrt(n), then compute rows accordingly.

    2) Constraint compliance:
       cols <= max_cols
       rows <= max_rows
       cols * rows <= max_cols * max_rows (implicitly)

    3) Safety:
       If n <= 0, return zeros.

    MATHEMATICS
    -----------
    - Start with a target column count near sqrt(n).
      sqrt(n) arises from minimizing (rows + cols) given rows * cols ≈ n.
    - Compute rows = ceil(n / cols) so that rows * cols >= n.
    - Clamp both cols and rows to the provided maxima.

    RETURNS
    -------
    (cols, rows, n_eff)
      n_eff = min(n, cols * rows) ensures we do not claim to place more agents
      than the rectangle can hold.

    NOTE ON INTEGER ARITHMETIC
    --------------------------
    - math.sqrt(n) yields float; int(...) truncates toward zero.
    - math.ceil(...) yields the smallest integer >= argument.
    """
    if n <= 0:
        return 0, 0, 0

    # Choose columns: at most max_cols, at least 1, close to sqrt(n).
    cols = min(max_cols, max(1, int(math.sqrt(n))))

    # Choose rows so that rows * cols can cover n placements.
    rows = min(max_rows, int(math.ceil(n / cols)))

    # Effective number of agents that can actually fit.
    n_eff = min(n, cols * rows)

#       1 -> mirror
#       2 -> tron
#       3 -> mirror
#       ...
# IMPORTANT:
#   Because this is at module scope, it persists across calls to spawn functions.
#   This is intentional when you want globally consistent alternation.

    Dedicated RNG so brain selection does NOT perturb world spawn RNG.
    If TEAM_BRAIN_MIX_SEED == 0 -> non-deterministic (SystemRandom).

    RATIONALE
    ---------
    In simulation code, coupling random streams can create subtle and unwanted
    correlations. For example, if brain selection consumes random numbers from
    the same RNG as coordinate sampling, changing brain selection strategy could
    change spawn locations, causing non-local behavioral differences.

    This function constructs a dedicated RNG stream for *brain assignment* so that:
      - random draws for brain architecture selection do not change the world RNG,
      - reproducibility is improved: one can vary brain mixing without changing
        spawn location patterns (assuming other RNG usage is separated similarly).

    CONFIGURATION
    -------------
    TEAM_BRAIN_MIX_SEED:
      - 0 => SystemRandom() (OS entropy; not reproducible)
      - non-zero => random.Random(seed + salt) (deterministic)

    SALTING
    -------
    A salt is added per team to ensure the red and blue teams do not share the
    same pseudo-random sequence when using a single base seed. This avoids
    mirrored brain selection patterns across teams.

    HIGH-LEVEL POLICY
    -----------------
    This function maps a team identity to a brain architecture name, governed by
    config-driven policies.

    Supported modes (TEAM_BRAIN_ASSIGNMENT_MODE):
      1) "exclusive" / "split" / "team"
         - Fixed architecture per team:
             red  -> tron
             blue -> mirror
         - This preserves older behavior and makes comparisons stable.

      2) "mix" / "hybrid" / "both"
         - Each team may spawn both architectures according to a strategy:
             a) alternate / roundrobin / rr
             b) random / prob / probabilistic

    STRATEGIES
    ----------
    alternate:
      - deterministic toggling based on per-team counter
      - guarantees near-50/50 split over time for each team

    probabilistic:
      - independent Bernoulli trial:
            tron with probability p_tron
            mirror otherwise
      - p_tron is clamped to [0, 1] for safety.

    ERROR HANDLING

    an intentionally "fail fast" policy: misconfiguration should surface early.

    MODES OF OPERATION
    ------------------
    There are two major execution regimes indicated by config.PPO_ENABLED:

    (A) Non-PPO mode
        - Returns scripted_transformer_brain(obs_dim, act_dim)
        - That function likely returns a TorchScript-compatible module.
        - Rationale: Inference-only / non-training runs benefit from scripting
          for performance and portability.

    (B) PPO mode
        - Returns one of: TransformerBrain, MirrorBrain, TronBrain
        - Architecture selection depends on TEAM_BRAIN_ASSIGNMENT and team identity.

    CONFIGURATION LOGIC
    -------------------

      - If TEAM_BRAIN_ASSIGNMENT is enabled AND team_is_red is provided:

    TYPE DISCUSSION
    ---------------
    - The return type is torch.nn.Module.
    - The brain is moved to the target device using .to(device) immediately.

      with the simulation's chosen hardware (CPU/GPU).

    WHY Optional[bool] for team_is_red?

    CONTRACTUAL CONSTRAINTS
    -----------------------
    The correctness of spawning depends on consistent assumptions across:
      - grid representation,
      - registry representation,
      - perception / raycasting / movement logic elsewhere in the codebase.

    The comment in the function summarizes these critical contracts:

      - Grid layout in this project:
          channel0 = team_id / empty / wall encoding
          channel1 = hp
          channel2 = slot

      - AgentsRegistry.register requires:
          slot + agent_id + vision_range keyword arguments.

    CELL OCCUPANCY CHECK
    --------------------
    grid[0, y, x] != 0.0 is considered occupied, meaning:
      - walls are non-zero,
      - agents are non-zero (team IDs),
      - any other non-zero sentinel values also block placement.

    This is a very common pattern in grid sims:
      channel0 is effectively a "solid occupancy" code.

    REGISTRATION PROCESS
    --------------------
    If free:
      1) compute stats based on unit type,
      2) allocate unique agent_id,
      3) call reg.register(...) to populate registry and attach brain,
      4) update grid channels to match the newly placed agent.

    FAILURE HANDLING
    ----------------
    Rejection sampling may fail if the map is too full.
    The code sets:

    FAIRNESS AND BIAS CONTROL

    first using probability proportional to remaining need:

        P(spawn_red_first) = red_to_spawn / (red_to_spawn + blue_to_spawn)

    This adaptive bias prevents one team from dominating placements simply
    due to ordering effects.

    NOTE ON SLOT ASSIGNMENT
