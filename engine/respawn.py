@dataclass
class RespawnCfg:
    """Configuration for agent respawning.

    DESIGN INTENT
    -------------
    This configuration object defines "what respawn should do" rather than
    embedding constants directly into logic. This approach yields:

      1) Reproducibility:
         - One can record or version the configuration for experiments.

      2) Backward compatibility:
         - Legacy fields remain, even if not used by the new controller.

      3) Separation of concerns:
         - Controller logic is parameterized; changes in behavior can be driven
           by config changes rather than code edits.

    COMPATIBILITY STRATEGY
    ----------------------
    For many fields, defaults are pulled from `config` via getattr(..., default).
    This ensures:
      - If a new config knob does not exist, a safe default is used.
      - Older config.py files still run without modification.

    NOTE ON TYPES
    -------------
    Fields are typed with bool / int / float for clarity and tooling.
    At runtime, the implementation frequently casts config values using int(...)
    or float(...), which ensures predictable types even if config values are
    accidentally provided as strings or NumPy scalars.

    ------

    PERFORMANCE
    -----------
    This uses vectorized tensor operations:
      alive = (d[:, COL_ALIVE] > 0.5)
      red   = sum(alive & team_is_red)
    which is significantly faster than Python loops, especially for large N.

    Split a budget inversely proportional to the two numbers.
    Used to give more respawns to the team with fewer alive agents.

    MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION
    ------------------------
    Let a = alive count for team A, b = alive count for team B.
    We define weights inversely proportional to counts:

        w_a = 1/a
        w_b = 1/b

    Total weight:

        S = w_a + w_b = 1/a + 1/b

    Allocate budget to team A as:

        q_a = round( budget * w_a / S )

    And team B gets the remainder:

        q_b = budget - q_a

    PROPERTIES
    ----------
    - If a < b then 1/a > 1/b, so q_a tends to be larger.
    - If a == b then q_a ≈ budget/2.
    - The rounding step ensures q_a is integer.
    - Using "remainder" ensures q_a + q_b == budget exactly.

    SAFETY
    ------
    The code clamps a and b to at least 1 to avoid division by zero.

    WHY INSTANTIATE A NEW MODULE IN PPO MODE?
    ----------------------------------------
    Deepcopy of PyTorch modules is not always reliable or efficient.
    Additionally, optimizer state and internal buffers may behave poorly if
    copied improperly. Creating a clean child module and selectively copying
    state_dict is a robust and explicit approach.

    WHY CONDITIONAL load_state_dict?
    --------------------------------
    state_dict compatibility requires matching parameter names and shapes.
    Loading weights into a different architecture would raise errors or,
    worse, silently misalign if forced (not done here).

    MATHEMATICAL MEANING
    --------------------
    For each trainable parameter tensor p (a vector or matrix of weights),
    we perform an in-place update:

        p ← p + N(0, std^2)   elementwise

    Where torch.randn_like(p) produces samples from N(0, 1) for each element.
    Multiplying by std scales to N(0, std^2).

    ENGINEERING NOTES
    -----------------
    - Mutation is applied only if p.requires_grad is True.
      This avoids perturbing frozen layers or buffers.
    - In-place add_ is used for efficiency.

    GRID CONTRACT (as documented elsewhere in the project)
    -----------------------------------------------------
    grid is shaped (C, H, W) with:
      grid[0, y, x] = occupancy code:
        0.0 empty
        1.0 wall
        2.0 red occupant
        3.0 blue occupant

    WALL MARGIN
    -----------
    The function enforces:
      cfg.wall_margin <= x < W - cfg.wall_margin
      cfg.wall_margin <= y < H - cfg.wall_margin

    This ensures spawns do not occur too close to borders.

    WHY .item()?
    ------------
    grid[...] returns a scalar tensor.
    .item() converts it into a Python number for comparisons.
    This is convenient but note:
      - .item() triggers a device-to-host sync if grid is on GPU.
      - For high-performance spawning at scale, one might prefer vectorized
        operations. Here the spawn count per tick is capped, so overhead is likely acceptable.

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
def respawn_tick(reg: AgentsRegistry, grid: torch.Tensor, cfg: RespawnCfg) -> None:
    """
    Perform one tick of respawning.

    BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY NOTE
    ---------------------------
    This function preserves the old signature:
      respawn_tick(reg, grid, cfg)

    However, it constructs a *new* RespawnController each call and invokes step
    with tick=0.

    IMPLICATIONS OF CONSTRUCTING A NEW CONTROLLER EACH CALL
    ------------------------------------------------------
    Because the controller is re-created:
      - cooldown state is reset every call,
      - _last_period_tick is reset every call,
      - periodic and hysteresis behavior will not behave as intended if you call
        respawn_tick repeatedly expecting statefulness.

    In other words, this wrapper is suitable for "one-off" respawn operations
    or compatibility stubs, but not for long-running tick-by-tick control unless
    it is replaced by a persistent controller instance elsewhere in the engine.

    LEGACY FIELDS
    -------------
    prob_per_dead_per_tick is explicitly ignored, as the new controller does not
    implement probabilistic respawn in this path.

    RETURN VALUE
    ------------
    None. step() returns counts, but they are ignored to match the old API.
    """
    controller = RespawnController(cfg)

    # Note: step returns counts, but we ignore them to match old API.
