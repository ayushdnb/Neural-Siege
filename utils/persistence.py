results_writer.py
=================

A **Windows-friendly**, **multiprocessing-based** background writer that records simulation/training
results to disk *without* stalling the main simulation loop.

Why this file exists (high-level)
---------------------------------
In simulations, reinforcement learning training loops, or real-time game-like engines, the main loop
often runs at high frequency (e.g., tens of ticks per second or more). Writing to disk (CSV/JSON)
can be unexpectedly expensive because:

1) Disk I/O is slow relative to CPU/GPU compute.
2) Python file writes can block.
3) CSV writers and frequent flushes can introduce latency spikes.
4) If you log a lot, the main loop may jitter (uneven tick time), causing unstable training or a laggy sim.

So the common engineering solution is:
- Put disk I/O into a **separate process**
- Send "write requests" (messages) from the main process to the writer process via a **Queue**
- The main process continues running almost uninterrupted.

This is exactly what this module implements.

Key architecture
----------------
Main Process (simulation/training loop)
    |
    |  (Queue message: "write this tick row")
    V
Writer Process (background)
    |
    |  writes CSV/JSON to disk
    V
Filesystem (results/sim_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS/...)

Important multiprocessing context (esp. on Windows)
---------------------------------------------------
On Windows, `multiprocessing` uses "spawn" (new Python process starts fresh) rather than "fork".
That means:
- The child process does NOT automatically inherit open file handles safely.
- You must open files inside the child process, not in the parent.
- Functions and objects used as process targets must be importable at top level.

This code follows those rules.

Performance philosophy
----------------------
- The main loop should never block on logging.
- If the queue is full, it's better to drop logs than to freeze the simulation.
  (This is a conscious choice: "best-effort" telemetry.)

No math-heavy content here
--------------------------
There is no advanced math in this module. The core concepts are systems/programming concepts:
- Producer/consumer queue
- Inter-process communication (IPC)
- Event/message-driven I/O

# Message Protocol (Typed "commands" sent to the writer process)
# =============================================================================
#
# We define a small set of message types. The main process will put these message
# objects into a multiprocessing.Queue. The writer process will read them and act.
#
# This pattern is often called:
# - "message passing"
# - "command pattern"
# - "actor model" (loosely)
#
# The purpose is to avoid sending raw tuples like ("write_tick", row) everywhere,
# and instead have explicit, typed message classes.
# This improves readability, correctness, and makes refactors safer.

    Design notes
    ------------
    1) We use `q.get(timeout=0.2)` instead of blocking forever so that:
       - the loop can periodically wake up
       - if you later add heartbeat logic or graceful shutdown checks, it's easy
       - it avoids hanging "forever" in certain edge cases

    2) Files are opened ONLY after _MsgInit is received.
       This ensures the run directory exists and the writer knows where to write.

    3) We flush after each write batch/row to reduce data loss if the program crashes.
       Trade-off: flushing frequently is slower. For critical logging, it's worth it.

    ResultsWriter
    =============

    A simple, non-blocking telemetry writer for simulations/training loops.

    The writer is implemented as a separate process that writes:
    - config.json
    - stats.csv (one row per tick)
    - dead_agents_log.csv (many rows per batch)
    - <label>.state_meta.json (model state metadata)

    Primary goals
    -------------
    1) Keep the main simulation loop fast (avoid blocking on disk I/O).
    2) Be Windows-friendly (spawn-safe).
    3) Be resilient: if queue is full, drop logs rather than freeze the sim.

    Usage pattern
    -------------
    writer = ResultsWriter()
    run_dir = writer.start(config_obj)

    for tick in ...:
        writer.write_tick({...})
        writer.write_deaths([...])  # optional

    writer.save_model_meta("policy", state_dict)  # optional
    writer.close()

    Notes
    -----
    - This class does NOT guarantee that every message is written.
      If the queue is full, it drops messages intentionally.
    - If you need strict durability (never lose a log), do NOT drop on queue.Full;
      instead block (but that may harm real-time performance).
