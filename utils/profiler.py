profiler_utils.py

Purpose
-------
This module provides two small, *optional* performance/diagnostics helpers:

1) torch_profiler_ctx(...)
   - A context manager that wraps `torch.profiler.profile` and emits a trace
     (Chrome/TensorBoard-compatible) **only when explicitly enabled**.
   - This keeps the main simulation/training code clean, while still making it
     easy to turn profiling on/off without modifying code.

2) nvidia_smi_summary()
   - A tiny utility that tries to call `nvidia-smi` (if available) and returns
     a one-line GPU utilization / memory / power summary.
   - Useful for logging periodic health checks in long-running experiments.

Design Principles
-----------------
- Opt-in behavior: profiling is OFF by default to avoid slowing experiments.
- Zero dependency on nvidia-smi: if it does not exist, we degrade gracefully.
- Minimal overhead when disabled: return quickly and do not import profiler.

def profiler_enabled() -> bool:
    """
    Decide whether profiling is enabled.

    Why an environment variable?
    ----------------------------
    In ML/Simulation projects, it's common to run the same code in many contexts:
    local dev, CI, remote machines, SLURM jobs, Docker containers, etc.

    If you tie profiling to code changes, you risk:
    - accidentally committing profiling instrumentation
    - changing runtime behavior between runs
    - forgetting to turn it off (profiling adds overhead)

    Using an env var makes profiling a runtime switch:
        FWS_PROFILE=1 python main.py

    Accepted values:
    - "1", "true", "True" => enabled
    - everything else     => disabled

    Returns
    -------
    bool
        True if profiling should be activated; otherwise False.

    # opt-in via env var or config flag you can pass down

@contextmanager
def torch_profiler_ctx(activity_cuda: bool = True, out_dir: str = "prof"):
    """
    Context manager: runs a minimal torch.profiler session when enabled.

    Usage Pattern
    -------------
    The typical call site looks like:

        with torch_profiler_ctx(activity_cuda=True, out_dir="prof") as prof:
            # ... your training/simulation loop ...
            # If prof is not None, you may call prof.step() each iteration.

    Important behavior:
    -------------------
    - If profiling is disabled, this yields None and returns immediately.
      That means calling code does not need to branch:
        `prof` is either a profiler object or None.

    Output
    ------
    When enabled, it will produce trace files via:
        torch.profiler.tensorboard_trace_handler(out_dir)

    These traces can be viewed with:
        tensorboard --logdir=prof

    Parameters
    ----------
    activity_cuda : bool
        Whether to include CUDA profiling activity (only if CUDA is available).
        If CUDA is not available, it silently falls back to CPU-only activities.

    out_dir : str
        Folder where profiler traces will be written.

    Notes on profiling schedule (performance + correctness)
    -------------------------------------------------------
    PyTorch profiler can be expensive. A schedule allows "sampling windows"
    that reduce overhead and avoid capturing startup noise.

    schedule(wait=2, warmup=2, active=6, repeat=1) means:
    - wait  : ignore first 2 steps (no recording)
    - warmup: next 2 steps (prepare/collect but typically not saved as final)
    - active: next 6 steps (recorded)
    - repeat: do this pattern once

    This is a practical choice for many loops:
    you skip initial jitter (memory allocation, kernel caching, graph warmup),
    then capture a representative steady-state segment.

    Returns (via yield)
    -------------------
    - When disabled: yields None
    - When enabled : yields a torch.profiler.profile object
    """
    # Fast path: if profiling is disabled, behave like a no-op context manager.
    # `yield None` allows callers to keep a uniform `with ... as prof:` structure.

    # We wrap profiling in a try/finally to ensure we always exit cleanly.

    finally:
        # `finally: pass` is intentionally empty.
        # Explanation:
        # - The `with profile(...)` block handles flushing/closing resources.
        # - Having a finally block keeps the structure ready for future cleanup hooks
        #   (e.g., logging "profiling finished", extra file management, etc.)

def nvidia_smi_summary() -> Optional[str]:
    """
    Query a short GPU status line via `nvidia-smi`, if available.

    What this does
    --------------
    - Checks if the `nvidia-smi` executable exists in PATH.
    - If it exists, runs a very short query returning:
        utilization.gpu, memory.used, memory.total, power.draw
      using CSV format without headers/units.
    - Returns only the first line (GPU 0) if multiple GPUs are present.

    Why it returns Optional[str]
    ----------------------------
    This function can fail for legitimate reasons:
    - system has no NVIDIA GPU
    - NVIDIA drivers not installed
    - `nvidia-smi` not in PATH
    - permission issues / runtime error
    - command timed out

    In all such cases, returning None is a clean, non-crashing behavior.
    It lets calling code do:

        line = nvidia_smi_summary()
        if line is not None:
            print("GPU:", line)

    Returns
    -------
    Optional[str]
        - A single CSV line (string) if successful, else None.

    Example returned string (no units, depends on GPU/driver):
