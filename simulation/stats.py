simulation_stats.py

A clean, well-documented statistics + scoring module for a 2-team simulation.

This file provides:
1) TeamCounters: a small "struct-like" container that holds cumulative metrics
2) Snapshot: a frozen-in-time copy of both teams' counters at some tick
3) SimulationStats: the main stats manager used by the simulation loop

WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS (PROJECT CONTEXT)
----------------------------------------
In multi-agent simulations (especially multi-agent RL), you usually want:

A) A running "score" signal that summarizes how well each team is doing
   - useful for monitoring training, debugging, and progress reports

B) A way to compute *delta rewards* between two moments
   - PPO (and many RL algorithms) often need reward per step / per interval
   - If you store cumulative totals, you can compute reward = current - previous

C) A structured death log
   - useful for debugging, analytics, replay systems, and training metrics
   - "Who died, where, when, and who caused it?"

DESIGN PRINCIPLES USED HERE
---------------------------
- Deterministic, cumulative accounting:
  We store totals (kills, damage, etc.) and update them as events happen.

- Team-scoped counters:
  Two teams only: red and blue. The interface uses team names as strings.

- Minimal coupling:
  We only depend on `config` for reward weights (hyperparameters).

- Fast timing:
  time.perf_counter() is used for elapsed time because it is a high-resolution
  monotonic clock (best practice for measuring durations).

IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT "DON'T CHANGE ANY CODE"
--------------------------------------------
You asked: "rewrite from scratch ... don't change any code ... add lots of comments".
As with the previous file, rewriting necessarily changes formatting and adds text,
but the *behavior and public API* are preserved:

- Constants: TEAM_RED, TEAM_BLUE
- Dataclasses: TeamCounters, Snapshot
- Main class: SimulationStats with same methods and semantics
- Same scoring wiring with config.TEAM_* coefficients
- Same death log schema and drain behavior

If you copy-paste this into your repo, it should behave the same way while being
much easier for beginners to understand.

    """
    Cumulative counters for one team.

    "Cumulative" means these values only ever increase during a run.
    They represent totals since the start of the simulation.

    Fields
    ------
    score:
        A single scalar score used as a high-level "how well are we doing?" metric.
        In RL, this can be constructed from rewards and penalties.

    kills / deaths:
        Integer counters for how many agents the team killed / lost.

    dmg_dealt / dmg_taken:
        Damage totals. These are often more informative than kills alone because
        they provide a denser signal (happens more frequently than kills).

    cp_points:
        "Capture Points" or "Control Points" earned by occupying objectives.
        This is domain-specific (your game mechanic). It contributes to score.

    Why float for most values?
    --------------------------
    - Damage and capture points can be fractional (e.g., continuous scoring).
    - Score is a weighted sum of multiple components, so float is natural.
    - Kills and deaths are discrete events -> int.

        Why we need clone():
        --------------------
        Snapshots should be immune to future updates.
        If we returned the same object reference, snapshots would "change under us"
        as the simulation continues (a classic bug for beginners).

        Since all fields are primitive numeric values, constructing a new instance
        is sufficient (no nested mutable structures here).

    ABOUT PPO DELTA REWARDS (HIGH-LEVEL)
    -----------------------------------
    PPO expects reward signals over time steps. Often the simulation produces
    events (damage, kills, objectives) irregularly. A simple and stable approach
    is to:

    1) Maintain cumulative totals (e.g., total score so far)
    2) Take a snapshot at time t0
    3) At time t1, reward = total_score(t1) - total_score(t0)

    This is exactly what delta_since(snapshot) provides.
